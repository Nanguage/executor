Executor Engine üöÄ is a powerful and versatile package designed for managing and streamlining job execution across various platforms. With support for multiple job types, including `LocalJob`, `ThreadJob`, `ProcessJob`, `DaskJob`, and more, Executor Engine provides flexibility and adaptability for a wide range of tasks. The package also offers extensible job types, such as `SubprocessJob` and `WebappJob`, ensuring that your workflow can be easily customized to meet specific requirements.

By harnessing the capabilities of Executor Engine, users can effortlessly construct parallel workflows to optimize their processing pipeline. The engine facilitates conditional job execution, allowing for the configuration of conditions such as `AfterAnother`, `AfterTimepoint`, and more. This level of customization simplifies the creation of complex, parallel workflows and maximizes efficiency.
